The aim of this Mini project is to show how an LED Blinks with the help of ATMEGA328 AVR Microcontroller with the help of the code dumped in it.

4W and 1H:
1)When - It will be used in simple projects to indicate it works.
2)Where - Televisions,Traffic Lights.
3)Why -  To indicate whether the Tv is working or it is in OFF mode.
4)What - It shows whether the led is ON,OFF OR Blinking.

1H:
1)How - With the help of Atmega328 Microcontroller and resistors we shows how the led is turn ON and OFF.

High level Requirements:
1)Atmega328 AVR Microcontroller
2)Resistors
Low level Requirements:
1)Port C
2)Ground(Gnd)
3)Crystal
